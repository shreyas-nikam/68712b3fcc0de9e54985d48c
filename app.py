In this lab, we explore operational risk modeling concepts, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application.
We'll define hypothetical scenarios, simulate Internal Loss Data (ILD), and combine these data sources using statistical averaging techniques.
A key objective is to visually demonstrate the counter-intuitive 'stability paradox' in risk aggregation.
