# Operational Risk Modeling and the Stability Paradox

## Introduction to Operational Risk Modeling
Duration: 0:05

Welcome to the QuLab Operational Risk Modeling Codelab! In this interactive guide, you'll explore fundamental concepts in operational risk management and gain hands-on experience with key modeling techniques. Operational risk refers to the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events. It's a broad category that can include everything from human errors and system failures to fraud and natural disasters.

Understanding and quantifying operational risk is crucial for businesses to:
*   **Allocate Capital:** Ensure they hold enough financial reserves to cover potential losses.
*   **Manage Risk:** Identify vulnerabilities and implement controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of adverse events.
*   **Comply with Regulations:** Meet industry standards and regulatory requirements (e.g., Basel Accords).

This application bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application. We'll simulate and analyze different sources of operational risk data and learn how to combine them for a comprehensive view. A key objective is to visually demonstrate the counter-intuitive 'stability paradox' in risk aggregation, a phenomenon where seemingly positive risk reductions can, in certain contexts, lead to an increase in overall estimated capital requirements.

Let's dive in!

## Step 1: Defining Hypothetical Scenarios (Scenario Fitting)
Duration: 0:15

In operational risk, **scenarios** are expert-based assessments of potential future loss events. These are often used to capture high-impact, low-frequency events that might not be sufficiently represented in historical data. This first section allows you to define such hypothetical scenarios and translate qualitative expert opinions into a quantitative statistical distribution.

To begin, navigate to the **"Scenario Fitting"** option in the sidebar.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Concept Highlight:</b> Scenario analysis is vital for capturing "tail risk" – the rare, extreme losses that can significantly impact an organization but occur infrequently. It complements historical data by incorporating forward-looking expert judgment.
</aside>

**How to Use This Section:**

1.  **Define Scenario Parameters:** You'll see input fields to define your hypothetical scenario:
    *   **Expected Annual Frequency (Scenario):** This represents how many times per year, on average, you expect this specific scenario to occur. For instance, a value of `1.0` means you expect it once a year.
    *   **50th Percentile Loss (Scenario):** This is the loss value below which 50% of scenario losses are expected to fall (the median loss).
    *   **90th Percentile Loss (Scenario):** This is the loss value below which 90% of scenario losses are expected to fall.
    *   **99th Percentile Loss (Scenario):** This is the loss value below which 99% of scenario losses are expected to fall, representing a high-impact event.

    <aside class="negative">
    <b>Important Check:</b> Ensure that your percentile values are strictly increasing (50th < 90th < 99th). The application will warn you if they are not, as this is a fundamental requirement for valid percentiles.
    </aside>

2.  **Fitted Scenario Distribution:** Once you've entered valid parameters, the application automatically fits a **Log-Normal distribution** to your expert estimates.

    The Log-Normal distribution is commonly used for modeling loss severities due to its ability to represent positively skewed data (many small losses, a few very large ones) and its non-negative nature. Its Probability Density Function (PDF) is given by:

    $$f(x; s, \text{loc}, \text{scale}) = \frac{1}{x s \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{(\ln(x - \text{loc}) - \ln(\text{scale}))^2}{2s^2}\right)$$
    where $x > \text{loc}$, $s$ is the shape parameter (related to standard deviation of the log-transformed data), and $\text{scale} = e^{\text{mu}}$ (geometric mean of the original data).

    You'll see the estimated parameters (s, loc, scale) displayed.

3.  **Interpretation of Plots:**
    *   **Probability Density Function (PDF):** This graph shows the relative likelihood of a loss occurring at a given amount. A higher curve at a certain loss amount indicates that losses of that magnitude are more probable. The peak of the PDF indicates the most probable loss range.
    *   **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):** This graph shows the probability that a loss will be less than or equal to a given amount. For example, if the CDF reaches `0.90` at a loss amount of `$5,000,000`, it means there's a 90% chance that a loss from this scenario will be `$5,000,000` or less. This is directly how we identify percentiles.

This step quantifies your expert opinions, transforming them into a statistical distribution that can be used for further analysis and aggregation.

## Step 2: Simulating and Fitting Internal Loss Data (ILD Generation and Fitting)
Duration: 0:20

**Internal Loss Data (ILD)** consists of an organization's own historical records of operational losses. It is a critical component of operational risk modeling, providing an empirical basis for understanding typical loss patterns. While scenarios focus on the tail, ILD often provides insights into the "body" of the loss distribution – the more frequent, smaller to medium-sized losses.

Navigate to the **"ILD Generation and Fitting"** option in the sidebar.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Concept Highlight:</b> ILD offers a factual, data-driven view of an organization's past operational risk exposures, making it invaluable for robust risk modeling.
</aside>

**1. Generate Synthetic ILD:**

Since real-world ILD is sensitive and often confidential, this section allows you to generate a synthetic dataset. You can configure the underlying characteristics of the simulated losses:

*   **Frequency Parameters:**
    *   **ILD Frequency Distribution (Poisson):** This models the number of loss events occurring per period (e.g., per year). The Poisson distribution is commonly used for event counts.
    *   **ILD Frequency Rate (lambda):** The average number of loss events per period.
    *   **Number of Simulation Periods:** The total number of periods (e.g., years) for which ILD will be simulated.
*   **Severity Parameters:**
    *   **ILD Severity Distribution:** This models the size of individual loss events. Options include Log-Normal, Pareto, or Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD).
    *   **Specific Parameters:** Depending on your chosen severity distribution, you'll input parameters like Mean/Sigma (for Log-Normal), Shape/Loc/Scale (for Pareto/GPD).
    *   **ILD Reporting Threshold:** A crucial parameter in practice. Organizations typically only record losses above a certain minimum amount. Losses below this threshold are not included in the generated ILD.

After generating, you'll see a summary of the generated data, including total losses, mean loss amount, and maximum loss amount, along with a histogram visualizing the distribution of the generated losses. This helps you understand the characteristics of your simulated historical data.

<aside class="negative">
<b>No Data Warning:</b> If no ILD data is generated, it means that, given your frequency, severity parameters, and reporting threshold, no simulated losses met the criteria to be recorded. Try increasing the frequency, adjusting severity parameters, or lowering the reporting threshold.
</aside>

**2. Fit Distribution to ILD:**

Once ILD is generated, the next step is to fit a statistical distribution to it. This allows us to generalize from the observed historical data to predict future loss behavior. You have two primary options:

*   **Log-Normal:** Fits a single Log-Normal distribution to the entire ILD dataset. This is a simpler approach, assuming one distribution can model all losses.
*   **Body-Tail:** This is a more sophisticated approach often used for operational risk. It recognizes that the "body" (smaller, more frequent losses) and the "tail" (larger, rarer losses) of a distribution often behave differently.
    *   The **body** (losses below a set threshold) is often represented empirically (e.g., by its histogram).
    *   The **tail** (losses above the threshold) is modeled by a **Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD)**. The GPD is particularly effective for modeling extreme values (tail events).

    If you choose "bodytail", you'll need to specify a **Threshold for Body-Tail Fit**. Losses below this value are considered part of the body, and losses above it contribute to the tail.

    You'll see the fitted parameters and plots (PDF/Histogram and CDF for Log-Normal, or a combined histogram with GPD tail for Body-Tail). The plots help you visually assess how well the chosen distribution(s) fit the generated data.

This step allows you to capture the empirical properties of your historical losses in a quantifiable form, making them ready for combination with scenario data.

## Step 3: Distribution Combination and Stability Paradox Simulation
Duration: 0:25

To get a complete picture of operational risk, it's essential to combine insights from both internal loss data (ILD) and expert scenarios. This section explores methods for doing so and then demonstrates a critical concept known as the "stability paradox."

Navigate to the **"Distribution Combination and Paradox Simulation"** option in the sidebar.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Concept Highlight:</b> Combining ILD and scenario data provides a more holistic view of operational risk, integrating both empirical evidence and forward-looking expert judgment to cover the entire spectrum of potential losses.
</aside>

### 1. Combining Distributions - Parameter Averaging

This method is useful when both your ILD and scenario loss severities can be characterized by similar distribution types, particularly those with "heavy tails" like Pareto distributions. It works by taking a weighted average of key parameters (like a tail shape parameter $\xi$) from each source.

*   **ILD Tail Parameter ($\xi_1$):** Input a value representing the tail characteristic derived from your ILD.
*   **ILD Precision (n):** This represents the effective amount of information or "precision" derived from the ILD. More data points or more reliable data would result in higher precision.
*   **Scenario Tail Parameter ($\xi_2$):** Input a value representing the tail characteristic derived from your scenario.
*   **Scenario Precision (m):** Similar to ILD precision, this represents the effective amount of information from your scenario. Expert judgment often has lower "precision" than extensive historical data.

The application calculates a **Combined Tail Parameter ($\xi_{1,2}$)** using the formula:
$$\xi_{1,2} = \frac{\xi_1 \cdot n + \xi_2 \cdot m}{n + m}$$
This formula effectively weights the individual tail parameters by their respective precisions. A higher precision value for a source means its parameter will have a greater influence on the combined result.

### 2. Combining Distributions - Quantile Averaging with Constant Weights

Another approach to combining distributions is to average their **quantiles** directly. Quantiles represent the loss values at specific probabilities (e.g., the 99th percentile is the loss value that is exceeded only 1% of the time). This method combines the quantiles of the ILD distribution and the scenario distribution using a geometric average with constant weights.

*   **Quantiles to Evaluate:** Select which percentiles (e.g., 90th, 95th, 99th) you want to see combined.
*   **Dummy Quantile Functions:** For demonstration, the application uses simplified "dummy" Log-Normal distributions for ILD and scenarios. In a real-world application, these would be the actual fitted distributions from previous steps.

The results are displayed in a table, showing the individual ILD and Scenario Quantiles alongside the Combined Quantiles. A plot visualizes how the combined quantile curve relates to the individual curves, showing the blended risk profile.

### 3. Simulating the Stability Paradox

This is arguably the most insightful part of the codelab. The **Stability Paradox** is a counter-intuitive phenomenon in risk aggregation. It suggests that seemingly positive changes in the "body" of a loss distribution (e.g., reducing the frequency of small losses) can, under certain conditions, paradoxically lead to an **increase** in the overall tail risk and the estimated risk capital (like Value-at-Risk, or VaR). This happens because improving the body might inadvertently reduce the diversification benefits that a diverse set of losses provides, or it might change the perceived likelihood of extreme events relative to the more frequent ones.

**How to Explore the Paradox:**

1.  **Base Scenario Parameters:** Define an initial hypothetical scenario with its frequency and percentiles. This represents your starting point.
2.  **Modified Body Scenario Parameters:** Define a second scenario where you *improve* the "body" characteristics compared to the base scenario. For example, you might:
    *   **Reduce the Frequency:** Decrease the "Modified Frequency" value compared to the "Base Frequency". This implies fewer small-to-medium events.
    *   **Keep Severity Similar:** Keep the 50th, 90th, and 99th percentiles for severity similar or even slightly lower than the base, focusing the "improvement" on the frequency of events.
3.  **ILD Parameters for Paradox:** These parameters define the independent Internal Loss Data that will be combined with both the Base and Modified scenarios. It's crucial that the ILD remains the same for both comparisons, as it acts as the constant backdrop against which the scenario changes are evaluated.
    *   You can adjust ILD frequency, severity distribution, and reporting threshold.

Once you set the parameters, the application will:
*   Simulate losses for both the Base Scenario and the Modified Scenario.
*   Simulate ILD losses.
*   Combine the Base Scenario losses with the ILD losses to form a "Combined Base Loss" distribution.
*   Combine the Modified Scenario losses with the ILD losses to form a "Combined Modified Loss" distribution.
*   Calculate the **Value-at-Risk (VaR)** at a 99.5% confidence level for both combined distributions. VaR at 99.5% indicates the maximum expected loss over a specific period with 99.5% confidence. It's a common measure for regulatory capital.

You will see the **Base Scenario VaR** and **Modified Scenario VaR** displayed. If the Modified Scenario VaR is higher than the Base Scenario VaR, the paradox is observed. The histogram plot will visually show the distribution of combined losses, allowing you to see how the tail behavior might change even if the main body of the distribution appears to improve.

<aside class="negative">
<b>Understanding the Implication:</b> The stability paradox highlights that risk management actions aimed at reducing frequent, small losses might not necessarily reduce the overall capital requirement, especially if the extreme tail events are not addressed or if other data sources have very fat tails. It underscores the complexity of aggregating different risk sources.
